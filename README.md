Basic_Java_Script_Library_App

This code sets up a simple library app with the ability to add, display, remove, and toggle the read status of books. It uses a basic HTML structure, styled with CSS, and functionality implemented with JavaScript. The form is initially hidden, and it appears when clicking the "New Book" button. The book information is displayed in a card format with options to remove the book or toggle its read status.
